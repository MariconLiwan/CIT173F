/**
For this exercise, you will use a list of ten of the largest cities in the world. 
(Please note, these are not the ten largest, just a selection of ten from the 
largest cities.) Create an array with the following values: Tokyo, Mexico City, 
New York City, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Lagos, Buenos Aires, Cairo, London.

Print these values to the browser separated by commas, using a loop to iterate over the array. 

Sort the array, then print the values to the browser in an unordered list, again using a loop.
Add the following cities to the array: Los Angeles, Calcutta, Osaka, Beijing. 
Sort the array again, and print it once more to the browser in an unordered list.
