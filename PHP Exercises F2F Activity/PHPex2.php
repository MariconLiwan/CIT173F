 For this PHP exercise, you will use them along with variables 
 to print equations to the browser. In your script, 
 create the following variables:

/**
Write code to print out the following:
10 + 7 = 17
10 - 7 = 3
10 * 7 = 70
10 / 7 = 1.4285714285714
10 % 7 = 3
Use numbers only in the above variable assignments, not in the echo statements.
